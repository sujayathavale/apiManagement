<!-- 
    This file shows how to use validate-jwt policy for validating RSA signed JWT tokens, by referencing the certificate uploaded to API Management.
    Assumption is that the certificate (rsa-cert.pfx), containing issuer's keys, used to sign, validate JWT tokens, has already been uploaded to API Management
    Substitute your own certificate-id value below
